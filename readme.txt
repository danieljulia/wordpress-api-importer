# Readme

This plugin imports via the wp rest api a remote wordpress in the current wordpress.
It only imports currently the posts, but with all the information
- title
- content
- images in the content (as media)
- featured image (as media)
- categories 
- tags 
- Publish date
- Slug
Currently is only a draft i used for a specific project, but the idea of importing as real content in Wordpress any wordpress site i think is awesome.
It could be modified to import other post types, and improved in several ways.
Enjoy.
